                <h4>Qualita Oro</h4>
                <h5>Qualita Oro is coffee from Central America and Africa, where it has thrived on the highlands. The
                    high plains are the favourite areas of the Arabica bean, because it is exposed to precisely the
                    temperature and winds that create optimal conditions for the plant's growth. The beans in this
                    coffee are 100% Arabica.</h5>

                    acidity than beans grown in the lowlands, thanks to slower ripening of the beans. This coffee comes

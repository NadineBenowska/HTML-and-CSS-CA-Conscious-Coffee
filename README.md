## Description

This is the GitHub repository for the Conscious Coffee e-commerce website, a cross-course project. The project initially involved designing a prototype for a coffee company called Conscious Coffee. Over time, the prototype evolved into a live site built with HTML and CSS.

The primary objective of this cross-course project is to create an e-commerce website for Conscious Coffee that offers a seamless user experience (UX/UI) and is easy to navigate. 

## Key Features

- The project started with creating a prototype and style tile. These elements served as the foundation for the visual design and layout of the website, ensuring a cohesive and appealing aesthetic.

- The live site is built using HTML and CSS, incorporating the design elements from the prototype. The frontend development focuses on creating a responsive and visually engaging website that aligns with the brand identity of Rainydays.
